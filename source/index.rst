About me
--------

I am a dedicated academic researcher who has achieved significant success as a
programmer, with a primary focus on advancing the field of computational
chemistry. Through my work, I have developed innovative coding solutions that
have greatly contributed to our understanding of the origins of spectroscopic
effects and the intricate interplay of spin-orbit and vibronic effects in
molecular systems. My work in this field is highlighted in my thesis, titled
*Spin Orbit Coupling and Vibronic Effects on Spectroscopic Properties of Metal
Complexes* (can find it
`here <https://www.proquest.com/openview/ad02ec9c0bae08b3d2dfcb917ef49ce9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y>`_),
which showcases the depth of my expertise.

  I have also made contributions to the professionally maintained
  `Amsterdam Density Functional <https://www.scm.com/product/adf/>`_ (ADF)
  FORTRAN program package, implementing a missing parameter
  in the theoretical calculations leading to a better comparison between theory
  and experiment. This showcases my ability to contribute quality and robust code
  to a large team of developers. This led to a publication in *ChemistryOpen*,
  which can be found `here <https://doi.org/10.1002/open.202200020>`_,
  underscoring my ability to drive practical advancements through my work.

  As a Graduate Research Assistant, I honed my programming skills, particularly
  in Python, where I developed a sophisticated library for calculating vibronic
  effects in molecules, employing a central finite difference approach. This work
  led to five publications, which are highlighted in my :ref:`Publications`.
  Among these publications is one in the prestigious
  journal, *Science Advances*, where my contributions as a programmer played a
  pivotal role in achieving the first quantitative comparison of theory and
  experiment for magneto-chiral dichroism. Additionally, I have extensive
  experience in setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
  pipelines using GitHub Actions, as well as utilizing version control tools like
  Git and SVN (Apache Subversion). My familiarity with high-performance computing
  clusters (HPC) and the Slurm workload manager further enrich my technical skill
  set.

  Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities as a Data Scientist or Machine
  Learning Engineer. My unique educational background, encompassing degrees in
  both physics and chemistry, equips me with a holistic perspective that
  facilitates pattern recognition and a deep understanding of coding solutions. I
  am not content with superficial comprehension; I possess an innate drive to
  delve into the intricacies of code, pinpoint issues, and find effective
  solutions. This attribute makes me an ideal candidate to identify program
  deficiencies and deliver the highest quality code that surpasses expectations.

  I am excited to contribute my knowledge and passion for programming to
  data-driven roles, where I can merge my research experience with cutting-edge
  technology to create a meaningful impact. If you seek a versatile and dedicated
  professional who brings innovation and problem-solving to the forefront, I am
  eager to explore how I can be a valuable asset to your team.

Doctoral Thesis (April 17th, 2023)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Title: **Spin Orbit Coupling and Vibronic Effects on Spectroscopic Properties of
Metal Complexes.** (Can be found in
`Proquest <https://www.proquest.com/openview/ad02ec9c0bae08b3d2dfcb917ef49ce9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y>`_)

.. dropdown:: Abstract
  :animate: fade-in

  The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is the cornerstone of modern quantum chemistry,
  reducing the number of terms in the ùëÅ-electron Hamiltonian. In nature, molecules can
  vibrate due to thermal energy breaking this approximation, and the inclusion of these
  effects is of great importance in describing spectra where nuclear motions play a
  role. Spin-orbit coupling is a relativistic effect that directly depends on the
  nuclear charge of the atom and contributes all of the calculated intensity in
  spin-forbidden transitions. In third-row transition metals, the effects of the spin
  operator in the magnetic moment are negligible. However, for heavy metal elements, the
  spin operator contributes a measurable amount to the magnetic dipole moment making it
  an important part of the overall theory. Modern quantum chemistry has made significant
  leaps in optimizing the approximations in the applied methods. However, vibronic and
  spin-orbit effects are important in describing natural phenomena and making qualitative
  comparisons to experimental results. This thesis shows a series of implementations
  expanding on the theory and understanding of vibronic effects and spin-orbit coupling
  as it applies to spin-forbidden transitions.
