# About me {#about}

I am a dedicated academic researcher who has achieved significant success as a programmer, with a primary focus on advancing the field of computational chemistry. Through my work, I have developed innovative coding solutions that have greatly contributed to our understanding of the origins of spectroscopic effects and the intricate interplay of spin-orbit and vibronic effects in molecular systems. My work in this field is highlighted in my thesis, titled _Spin Orbit Coupling and Vibronic Effects on Spectroscopic Properties of Metal Complexes_ (can find it <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/ad02ec9c0bae08b3d2dfcb917ef49ce9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y" target="_blank">here</a>), which showcases the depth of my expertise.

I have also made contributions to the professionally maintained <a href="https://www.scm.com/product/adf/" target="_blank">Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF)</a> FORTRAN program package, implementing a missing parameter in the theoretical calculations leading to a better comparison between theory and experiment. This showcases my ability to contribute quality and robust code to a large team of developers. This led to a publication in _ChemistryOpen_, which can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/open.202200020" target="_blank">here</a>, underscoring my ability to drive practical advancements through my work.

As a Graduate Research Assistant, I honed my programming skills, particularly in Python, where I developed a sophisticated library for calculating vibronic effects in molecules, employing a central finite difference approach. This work led to five publications, which are highlighted in my publication section [below](#publications). Among these publications is one in the prestigious journal, _Science Advances_, where my contributions as a programmer played a pivotal role in achieving the first quantitative comparison of theory and experiment for magneto-chiral dichroism. Additionally, I have extensive experience in setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions, as well as utilizing version control tools like Git and SVN (Apache Subversion). My familiarity with high-performance computing clusters (HPC) and the Slurm workload manager further enriches my technical skill set.

Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. My unique educational background, encompassing degrees in both physics and chemistry, equips me with a holistic perspective that facilitates pattern recognition and a deep understanding of coding solutions. I am not content with superficial comprehension; I possess an innate drive to delve into the intricacies of code, pinpoint issues, and find effective solutions. This attribute makes me an ideal candidate to identify program deficiencies and deliver the highest quality code that surpasses expectations.

I am excited to contribute my knowledge and passion for programming to data-driven roles, where I can merge my research experience with cutting-edge technology to create meaningful impact. If you seek a versatile and dedicated professional who brings innovation and problem-solving to the forefront, I am eager to explore how I can be a valuable asset to your team.

# Coding projects

1. <a href="https://github.com/herbertludowieg/vibrav" target="_blank">VibrAv</a> (<a href="https://herbertludowieg.github.io/vibrav" target="_blank">docs</a>): A Python library for computational chemists who are trying to compute vibronic properties vi a central finite difference approach. There are three primary modules to compute the Zero-Point Vibrational Corrections (ZPVC), Vibrational Raman Optical Activity (VROA), and Vibronic Coupling (VC). The ZPVC module has been adapted to approximate first and second derivatives with two, four, six, or eight points, increasing the accuracy of the approximated derivatives significantly. The results of this library have been shown in five scientific publications in prestigious journals.
