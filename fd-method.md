# A look at the finite difference method

The finite difference method is a method that we can use to approximate derivatives. In fact, in many precalculus classes, this is introduced via the equation,

$$
f^{\prime}(x_o) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_o+h) - f(x_o)}{h}
$$

$$
f(x_o+h) = f(x_o) + f^{(1)}(x_o)h + \frac{1}{2!}f^{(2)}(x_o)h^2
               +...+ \frac{1}{n!}f^{n}(x_o)h^n+R_n(x_o)
$$

## Difference between forward, backward, and central FD approaches

### Forward difference

### Backward difference

### Central difference

## Computing the FD coefficients

Here I will put fancy text on how to compute the FD coefficients as seen on [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_coefficient).
